### auto-e2e

Browser automation recording/replay tool. Generate reusable single-file Playwright scripts through natural language descriptions.

**Version:** 2.2.0

#### Usage

**Record Mode**
```
/auto-e2e https://example.com
/aee https://example.com record
```
After opening the page, describe each step in natural language (e.g., "click login button", "enter username xxx"). Agent executes and records. Supports undo, variable extraction, and return data specification.

**Capture Mode**
```
/auto-e2e capture https://example.com
/aee capture https://example.com
```
In capture mode, you operate the browser directly. The recorder observes your actions and converts them into reusable steps. No need to narrate each step in chat. Supports click, fill, select, check, key press, and navigation.

**Replay Mode**
```
/auto-e2e replay login flow
/aee replay { "targetUrl": "...", "messages": [...] }
```
Match historical recordings by natural language query, or pass a JSON replay baseline directly. Compares expected results during execution, pauses on mismatch.

**Storage Capture**
```
/auto-e2e storage user1 https://example.com/login
/aee storage admin https://example.com/login append
```
Capture login credentials to `~/.auto-e2e/.auth/<name>.json` without generating a script. Use `append` to extend an existing storage-state with additional login flows.

**Script Management**
```
/aee list
/aee rm login-flow.mjs
```
List all saved scripts or remove a specific script.

**Alias Binding**
```
/auto-e2e alias login login-flow-script
```
Bind a short alias to a generated script for easy invocation.

**Alias Invocation**
```
/auto-e2e login username test@example.com
```
Execute script by alias with variable parameters.

#### Browser Runtime Options

- `incognito mode` / `用隐身模式` - Use incognito/private mode
- `reuse profile <name>` / `复用 profile <name>` - Reuse specified browser profile
- `reuse login state <name>` / `复用登录态 <name>` - Reuse storage-state from `.auth/<name>.json`
- `headless` / `无头模式` - Run in headless mode
- `headed` / `有头模式` - Run with visible browser

#### Output

Scripts are saved in `~/.auto-e2e/` directory (shared across agents):
- `<name>.mjs` - Standalone Playwright script
- `records/<name>.json` - Recording session log (record mode)
- `.auth/<name>.json` - Named storage-state files (login credentials)
- `package.json` - Alias and credential metadata
